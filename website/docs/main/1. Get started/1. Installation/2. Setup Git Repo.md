# Setup Repository

## Step 2: Set up a `git` Repository

:::note

e strongly recommend utilizing a git repository for efficient version control. While any git 
rovider can be used for this purpose, we will use Github for this tutorial. Github is not only 
he most popular choice, but also offers the added benefits of hosting websites with Github 
ages and an automated release pipeline.

### 1) Register a Github Account

If you do not have a Github account yet, you can register for one [here](https://github.com/join).

### 2) Create a New Repository

Proceed to create a new repository for your Docusaurus website and Obsidian vault.

:::danger Public vs. Private Repository

Please note that with a free Github subscription, you cannot use Github Pages without **making your repository public, and thus, accessible to every user on the internet.** This implies that your **vault with all files & settings, including files in draft mode will be fully exposed.** If you wish to keep your repository private, you will need to either upgrade your Github account to enable Github Pages on a private repository, or explore alternative deployment methods.

### 3) Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine

To clone the repository, open a terminal and execute the following command: 
- `git clone https://github.com/{USERNAME}/{REPOSITORY}.git`

### 4) Add a `.gitignore` file to the root

Obsidiosaurus creates JSON files at the root of your repo to keep track of the conversion.
It allows a smart conversion, it only converts what has been actual changed.

Add in your `.gitignore`
```
allSourceAssetsInfo.json
allFilesInfo.json
assetInfo.json
```

### 5) Access the Repository Folder using VSCode

Once you have cloned the repository to your local machine, you can open the repository folder with Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

### 6) Initiate a New Terminal Session in VSCode

If you haven't already, start a new Terminal session in VSCode.

Your Terminal session should now be directed to your repository's root folder.
