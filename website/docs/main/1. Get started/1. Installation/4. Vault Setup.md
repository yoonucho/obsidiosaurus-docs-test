# Vault Setup

## Step 4: Configure your Vault

### 1) Create a Folder

Create a new folder named `vault` in your root repository folder.

Your directory structure should now look like this:
```js
{REPOSITORY}/
├── vault/
│   └── (Obsidian Vault lives here)
└── website/
    └── (Docusaurus Installation is here)
```

### 2) Open the vault 

It's time to launch your Obsidian application. Open the `vault` folder in your repository. 
You should now see an empty Obsidian vault names 'vault'.

### 3) Create an Attachments Folders

Create a folder for your attachments.

All images and documents have to be placed in this specific folder. If you choose a different name for the folder, remember to update this is in your Obsidiosaurus plugin settings as well.

Obsidiosaurus can convert your Excalidraw sketches to Docusaurus, supporting both light and dark mode versions. To enable this, ensure your settings match the ones shown below:

![excalidraw_plugin_settings_folders](//assets/excalidraw_plugin_settings_folders.webp)
:::note

 The `Excalidraw folder` should be the same as your attachments folder in Obsidan.
:::

![excalidraw_plugin_settings_filename](//assets/excalidraw_plugin_settings_filename.webp)

:::danger Filename Date:

Additional periods (`.`) in the filename will disrupt the conversion process. It's best to only use 
`YYYY-MM-DD`, replace periods with hyphens (`-`), or leave this field empty

Allowing you to also resize your Excalidraw drawings.
:::

#### Diagrams.net (optional)

No settings to change available.

:::note Light and Dark mode

If you want your website to support both light and dark modes, please be aware that the
current version only exports in light mode. Using colors like white and black may appear
incorrect in dark mode.
