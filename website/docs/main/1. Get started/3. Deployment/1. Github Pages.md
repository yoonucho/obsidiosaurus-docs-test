# Deploying to Github Pages

For more information refer to the [official Docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#deploying-to-github-pages)

If you already have a Github Repo an easy way is to use Github Pages for your deployment of Docusaurus.

:::danger Public vs. Private Repository

Please note that with a free Github subscription, you cannot use Github Pages without **making your repository public, and thus, accessible to every user on the internet.** This implies that your **vault with all files & settings, including files in draft mode will be fully exposed.** If you wish to keep your repository private, you will need to either upgrade your Github account to enable Github Pages on a private repository, or explore alternative deployment methods.

## Adjust your Docusaurus Config

In your `docusaurus.config` file:
```js
const config = {
  ...
  url: 'https://{your-username}.github.io',
  baseUrl: '/{repository-name}/',
  ...
  }
```

Change `{your-username}` with your Github Username or Organisation and the `{repository-name}` with your actual repository name on Github.

## Automated Deployment with Github Actions

Manually releasing can be time-consuming.

In the root directory `.../repository/.github/workflows/` create a `deploy.yml` file

```
{REPOSITORY}/
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── deploy.yml <- Create this file
```

Use either `push to main branch` or `tags` deploy method see below:

### Deploy with push to main branch

This deploy method works whenever use `git push`

Change your `deploy.yml` file to following:

```yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: npm
          cache-dependency-path: ./website/package-lock.json
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          cd website
          npm ci
      - name: Build website
        run: |
          cd website
          npm run build

      # Popular action to deploy to GitHub Pages:
      # Docs: https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#%EF%B8%8F-docusaurus
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # Build output to publish to the `gh-pages` branch:
          publish_dir: ./website/build
          # The following lines assign commit authorship to the official
          # GH-Actions bot for deploys to `gh-pages` branch:
          # https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/13#issuecomment-724415212
          # The GH actions bot is used by default if you didn't specify the two fields.
          # You can swap them out with your own user credentials.
          user_name: github-actions[bot]
          user_email: 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
```

:::caution Renamed Docusaurus Folder

If you have renamed your Docusaurus folder make sure to replace `website` with your changed name.
:::

### Deploy with tags

If you don't want to release your current state with every `git push` you can use tags

1. Use the `.yml` script as shown above, change the first part of the `deploy.yml`:

```yml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "*"
```

2. Create a tag that matches the version in the `manifest.json` file.

```bash
git tag -a 1.0.1
git push origin 1.0.1
```

:::note

 `-a` creates an [annotated tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging#_creating_tags).
