# Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome to **Obsidiosaurus**!

The tool that combines the strengths of [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) and [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs)

Obsidiosaurus serves as a **bridge** that connects your Obsidian Vault to the Page builder Docusaurus.

It translates the special Markdown syntax of Obsidian and converts your files so that Docusaurus can process them directly.

:::danger Development Version

Currently the tool is in a very early development version.

## Always back up your important notes!

## Expect bugs and breaking changes!

## Follow Installation precisely
